5</span>INTRODUCTION<br />
<i>Borrow and the Kj&aelig;mpeviser</i>.</h2>
<p>The modern poetical literature of Denmark opens with a
collection of epical and lyrical poems from the Middle Ages,
which are loosely connected under the title of
<i>Kj&aelig;mpeviser</i> or Heroic Ballads.&nbsp; Of these the
latest scholarship recognises nearly 500, but in the time of
Borrow the number did not much exceed 200.&nbsp; These ballads
deal with half-historic events, which are so completely masked by
fantastic, supernatural and incoherent imagery that their
positive relation to history can rarely be discovered.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, they throw a very valuable light upon the manners
of mediaeval society in Scandinavia, and they are often of high
poetical beauty.&nbsp; No conjecture can be formed as to the
authors of these ballads, and even the centuries in which they
were composed are uncertain.&nbsp; Grimm believed them to be
<i>uralt</i>, and attributed them to the 5th and 6th
centuries.&nbsp; But on linguistic <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>grounds, this
extreme antiquity cannot be maintained.&nbsp; It is now supposed
that they were composed at various times between 1300 and 1500,
and that in their present form they bear the stamp of the period
when they were first collected by the Danish antiquaries of the
sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The circumstances in which this famous collection of
folk-songs came into public notice were of a romantic
nature.&nbsp; Sophia, Queen of Denmark, when sailing across the
Sound in the year 1586, was driven by stress of weather to take
shelter in the little island-harbour of Hveen, where the famous
observatory stood, close by the house of the astronomer, Tycho
Brahe.&nbsp; It so happened that at that very time Brahe was
entertaining as a guest the most eminent Danish man of letters of
that age, Anders S&ouml;rensen Vedel (1542&ndash;1616).&nbsp;
Vedel, whose labours were encyclop&aelig;dic, was engaged in
preserving all the monuments of Danish mediaeval history and
learning which he could discover in the monasteries and libraries
of Denmark.&nbsp; He had been much encouraged in this work by the
Monk of Roeskilde, Peder Olufsen, who on his death-bed, about
1570, had placed in Vedel&rsquo;s hands all the MSS. which he had
collected.&nbsp; Queen Sophia, <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>cloistered in
the Ouranienborg with her antiquary and her astronomer, and
waiting for the tempest to moderate, desired to be amused with
stories of her national history.&nbsp; Vedel ventured to read to
her some of the legendary poems which still lingered among the
people, and she was so enchanted with them, that she commanded
him, when he returned to the mainland, to make a collection of
these ballads and publish them.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in 1591, Vedel issued from the private
printing-press in his house called Liljeborg at Ribe in Jutland,
a selection of 100 mediaeval ballads, under the title of <i>Et
Hundred udvalgte danske Viser</i>.&nbsp; This volume is one of
the landmarks of Scandinavian, and indeed of European, literary
history.&nbsp; Vedel made another collection, this time of
ancient love-ballads, which he called <i>Tragica</i>; it was not
published until 1657, long after his death.&nbsp; But the volume
of 1591 is the fountain-head of all that has since been written
about the Heroic Ballads of the North, and it is impossible to
overrate the services of Vedel in preserving what was even then
ready to disappear.&nbsp; It seems, moreover, that he was careful
of the text, and later scholarship has come more and more to
place confidence in his transcripts.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>This was, unfortunately, not the case with the next
pioneer in the same field, although he deserves great credit
also.&nbsp; Peter Petersen Syv (1631&ndash;1702) was a very able
philologist, who was also a minor poet of ambition.&nbsp; In 1695
he reprinted and edited Vedel&rsquo;s text, adding 100 more
<i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i> which had been unknown to Vedel.&nbsp;
But his work was not so well done; Syv was something of a pedant,
and unfortunately either too critical or not critical
enough.&nbsp; He ventured to correct the irregularities of the
ballads, and not seldom has spoiled them.&nbsp; He bore the proud
title of Philologer Royal of Denmark, and he was above all things
else a grammarian.&nbsp; But he added to our store of
Ballads.&nbsp; No one, during the eighteenth century, advanced on
the labours of Vedel and Syv, and their treasuries of beautiful
anonymous poetry seem to have attracted no attention in the rest
of Europe.</p>
<p>But in the first decade of the nineteenth century, in
consequence of what we call the Romantic Revival, poets and
scholars in many countries turned simultaneously to the
treasure-house of Danish balladry.&nbsp; Jamieson&rsquo;s work,
to which I shall presently return, dates from 1806; about the
same time Herder translated one or two <i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i>
in his <i>Stimmen der V&ouml;lker</i>, and in <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>1809 Wilhelm
Carl Grimm started his full translation, under the title of
<i>Altd&auml;nische Heldenlieder</i>, <i>Balladen and
M&auml;rchen</i>, which appeared in 1811.&nbsp; But it appears
that Grimm had heard and perhaps even seen the proofs of a Danish
edition of the very highest importance, the <i>Udvalgte Danske
Viser fra Middlealderen</i>, the first volume of which was
brought out by Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek in 1812. <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; Abrahamson dropped out, but the
work was completed by the others, the fifth and last volume
appearing in 1814.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s relation to these texts must now be considered,
and it offers some difficulty.&nbsp; In 1826 he published a
volume of verse entitled <i>Romantic Ballads translated from the
Danish</i>, and in the <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>preface he uses these
words:&mdash;&ldquo;I expect shortly to lay before the public a
complete translation of the <span
class="smcap">Ki&aelig;mp&eacute; Viser</span>, made by me some
years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is necessary to bear in mind that
there are these two collections of Borrow&rsquo;s translations
from the <i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i>, the second of which, as we
shall see, he did not contrive to publish.</p>
<p>No doubt, he was anxious to emphasise the novelty and rarity
of his literary adventures.&nbsp; But his attitude to Jamieson is
very strange.&nbsp; As early as 1806 Robert Jamieson
(1780&ndash;1844) had published a volume of <i>Popular
Ballads</i>, in which he had translated several of the
<i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i> and had pointed out their value in
relation to the ancient Scottish poems of a similar kind.&nbsp;
Sir Walter Scott paid much flattering attention to
Jamieson&rsquo;s work, which also attracted a good deal of notice
in Denmark and Germany, and inspired the <i>Drei altschottische
Lieder</i> of G. D. Gr&auml;ter (1813).&nbsp; It is scarcely
possible that Borrow was not aware of all this, yet he never
mentions the name of Jamieson, and in 1826 he spoke boldly of
himself as breaking into &ldquo;unknown and untrodden
paths.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not impossible that Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s patronage of Jamieson had something to do with the
ungenerous petulance of Borrow&rsquo;s references to the great
novelist in <i>Lavengro</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>But Borrow&rsquo;s attitude to the contemporary scholars
of Denmark is still more surprising.&nbsp; Without saying so in
exact words, he gives us to understand that he translated all the
<i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i> from the original edition of
Vedel.&nbsp; It would be rash to say that Borrow was not
acquainted with the <i>Danske Viser</i> of 1591, for he does, in
one place, quote, whether at first-hand or not, from
Vedel&rsquo;s preface.&nbsp; But it requires great faith to
accept his own account of his approach to the poems.&nbsp; In
<i>Lavengro</i>, at a point which Knapp has dated 1820, Borrow
tells with brilliant picturesqueness how he purchased, by
permitting the wife of an elderly yeoman to kiss his cheek,
&ldquo;a strange and uncouth-looking volume&rdquo; which had
formed part of the kit of some red-haired fishermen who were
wrecked on the Norfolk coast:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It was not very large, but instead of the usual
covering was bound in wood, and was compassed with strong iron
clasps.&nbsp; It was a printed book, but the pages were not of
paper, but vellum, and the characters were black, and resembled
those generally termed Gothic. . . .&nbsp; And now I had in my
possession a Danish book, which, from its appearance, might be
supposed to have belonged to the very old Danes indeed: but how
was I to turn it to any account?&nbsp; I had the book it is true,
but I did not understand the language, and how was I to overcome
that difficulty?&nbsp; Hardly by poring over the book; yet I did
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>pore over the book again, but with all my poring I could
not understand it; and then I became angry, and I bit my lips
till the blood came; and I occasionally tore a handful from my
hair and flung it upon the floor, but that did not mend the
matter, for still I did not understand the book, which however I
began to see was written in rhyme. . . .&nbsp; For the book was a
book of ballads, about the deeds of knights and champions, and
men of huge stature. . . . collected by one Anders Vedel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story of a vellum copy of the rare edition of 1591 thrown
up on the shore of Norfolk with a common sailor&rsquo;s effects
is told in Borrow&rsquo;s best style.&nbsp; But how far is it
true?&nbsp; Whether it is entirely or only partly romance, the
inference that Borrow translated the <i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i> by
the light of nature from this &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; text must be
abandoned.&nbsp; He may or may not have handled a copy of Vedel,
but he made his translations, as internal evidence amply proves,
from the five volumes of Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek, published
between 1812 and 1814.&nbsp; This was a cheap and highly
accessible edition, and was in the hands of the booksellers
complete at least six years before Borrow began to read
Danish.&nbsp; He accepted the text of these scholars and their
arrangement; he translated their notes word for word,&mdash;and
gave them out as his own; his volume of 1826 and the privately
printed <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>later ballads are wholly founded upon
Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek, and yet, so far as I can discover,
he never mentions their names in any part of his writings.&nbsp;
He professed that the public should believe his knowledge to be
wholly derived from a mysterious black-letter volume washed up on
the sands of his native county, and read by him with agonies of
labour by the pure light of divination.</p>
<p>In January, 1830, a prospectus was put forth in which
&ldquo;<i>The Songs of Scandinavia</i>, <i>translated by Dr.
Bowring and Mr. Borrow</i>&rdquo; was offered to subscribers at
the price of a guinea.&nbsp; This was an attempt on the part of
Borrow, languidly assented to by Bowring, to give publicity to
some 70 <i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i> which the former had translated
since the publication of his <i>Romantic Ballads</i> of
1826.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am terribly afraid,&rdquo; writes Borrow,
&ldquo;of being forestalled in the K&aelig;mpe Viser by some of
those Scotch blackguards,&rdquo; a hit, no doubt, at
Jamieson.&nbsp; He was working hard at his translations, and he
was further stimulated by meeting in London with the Danish
theologian and poetical student, Nikolai Frederik Severin
Grundtvig, who had done much to popularise the
<i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i> in his native country.&nbsp; But Bowring
proved a broken reed, and Borrow suffered once <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>again one of
those disappointments which so naturally embittered him.&nbsp; It
was not until 1874, however, some seven years before his death,
that he finally gave up all hope.&nbsp; The MSS. of his
translations of the <i>kj&aelig;mpeviser</i> passed into the
hands of Mrs. MacOubrey.</p>
<p>The ballad of <i>Grimhild&rsquo;s Vengeance</i> (<i>Grimhilds
Hevn</i>) is given in three versions by Abrahamson, Nyerup and
Rahbek.&nbsp; Borrow has closely followed the editors of 1812 and
has translated each of the versions.&nbsp; He added a number of
notes, the MS. of which is mutilated, but not so much so as to
prevent us from observing that these are translated word for word
from the appendix of Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek, but, so far
as can be discerned from the fragmentary and mutilated
Manuscripts at our disposal, without a sign of
acknowledgment.</p>

15</span>GRIMHILD&rsquo;S VENGEANCE<br />
<i>Song the First</i></h2>
<p>It was the proud Dame Grimhild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepares the mead and beer,<br />
And unto her the valiant knights<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She bids from far and near.</p>
<p>She bade them come and not delay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To tournament and strife;<br />
It was the Hero Hogen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who lost his youthful life.</p>
<p>It was the Hero Hogen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the shore went he,<br />
And there he found upon the sand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maiden of the sea.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Now hail, thou maiden of the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of wisdom thou art rife;<br />
Say, if I go to Hvenild&rsquo;s land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I retain my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of castles hast thou plenty, knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And store of gold so red,<br />
If thou shouldst go to Hvenild&rsquo;s land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wilt be smitten dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Hero Hogen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He straight drew forth his blade,<br />
And he struck off at a single blow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The head of the ocean-maid.</p>
<p>Then out amid the Sound he cast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The head all dropping gore;<br />
The body rolled down after it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the deep they joined once more.</p>
<p>It was the Hero Hogen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He further wandered on,<br />
Until the Ferry-carl he spied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ocean beach upon.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>&ldquo;I will not take thee o&rsquo;er the Sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all thy gold so red,<br />
If thou dost go to Hvenild&rsquo;s land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wilt be smitten dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Hero Hogen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His faulchion round did whirl,<br />
And he struck off at a single blow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The head of the Ferry-carl.</p>
<p>He gave the gold ring off his arm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the dead man&rsquo;s wife:<br />
&ldquo;Take that as an atoning gift<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Ferryman&rsquo;s young life.&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; So wild the waters&rsquo; roar.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; So wild the waters grew,<br />
Asunder soon in Hogen&rsquo;s hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The oar of iron flew.</p>
<p>The iron oar asunder flew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Hero Hogen&rsquo;s hand,<br />
Then with their broad and gilded shields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heroes steered to land.</p>
<p>They &rsquo;gan to scour their faulchions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they to land had won;<br />
And there so proud a Damsel stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their employ looked on.</p>
<p>O she was slender at the waist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And just of proper height;<br />
Swelling was her white bosom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And maidenlike her gait.</p>
<p>They went away to N&ouml;rborough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the gate was wont to stand:<br />
&ldquo;O where is now the porter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who here should be at hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;er many a league of land and sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We hither have repaired;<br />
Dame Grimhild is our sister,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is now declared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In then went the porter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His stand by the board he took;<br />
Quoth he: &ldquo;Before our portal wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two knights of noble look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men of birth illustrious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now wait before our gate;<br />
The one he bears a fiddle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a gilded helm his mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O he no fiddle bears, I trow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For any noble&rsquo;s pay;<br />
And whencesoever they are come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A prince&rsquo;s sons are they.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>It was the proud Dame Grimhild drew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mantle o&rsquo;er her head;<br />
She hurried to the castle hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in her brothers bade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O will ye go to bower now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink the mead and wine?<br />
Or will ye sleep in beds of silk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With two fair maids of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the proud Dame Grimhild drew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mantle o&rsquo;er her head,<br />
And into the stone chamber<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To her warriors all she sped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here sit ye all my valiant men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink the mead and wine;<br />
Now who will Hero Hogen slay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he be brother mine?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoe&rsquo;er will do the doughty deed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of striking Hogen dead,<br />
Shall master of my castles be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of my gold so red.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; A baron of that land:<br />
&ldquo;O I will earn the prize this day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forsooth with this good hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I will do the doughty deed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strike Hero Hogen dead;<br />
Then I will o&rsquo;er thy castles rule,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And o&rsquo;er thy gold so red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered Folker Spillemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With mighty iron spear:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set my mark upon thee, knave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before thou scap&rsquo;st from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the first blow he has laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full fifteen warriors low:<br />
&ldquo;Ha bravely, Folker Spillemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You touch your fiddle bow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smote to death the warriors,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A bridge of them he made;<br />
And broad and long I ween it was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full rough with them he play&rsquo;d.</p>

Upon his two knees stood he then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And got his mortal wound.</p>

24</span>GRIMHILD&rsquo;S VENGEANCE<br />
<i>Song the Second</i></h2>
<p>It was the proud Dame Grimhild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wine with spices blends;<br />
And unto many a hero free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She messengers outsends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go bid them come to battle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go bid them come to strife;<br />
I reckon many a hero free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall lose his youthful life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Hero Hogen&rsquo;s mother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She has dreamt a wondrous dream,<br />
That the stately courser tumbled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they rode him o&rsquo;er the stream.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;That dream, dear son, a meaning has,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I rede thee cautious be;<br />
Beware thee of thy sister,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She deals in treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Hero Hogen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He rode along the strand:<br />
The mermaid there he found at play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the yellow sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me, pretty mermaid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The future thou dost know,<br />
Shall I the prize in Hvenland win,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And warriors overthrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen, Hero Hogen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art of kemps the flower,<br />
Enough of land thou dost possess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough of fame and power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou both gold and silver hast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And castles fair to see,<br />
If thou dost go to Hvenland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thy best it will not be.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;Goods and dominion hast thou, knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And store of gold so red,<br />
If thou dost go to Hven this year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wilt be smitten dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Hero Hogen, he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grew wrathful at her speech;<br />
He strook the wretched mermaid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That she fell dead on the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There do thou lie and rest thee now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou foul and wicked fay;<br />
I know well how to guard me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my enemies to slay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There rode up to the portal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Dame Grimhilda&rsquo;s home,<br />
Two men of noble bearing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their steeds were all in foam.</p>
<p>The blow they gave the portal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rang all the castle through:<br />
&ldquo;O where art thou the porter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why dost thou not undo?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Then up and spoke the porter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So ready to deceive:<br />
&ldquo;I dare admit no stranger, Sirs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without my Lady&rsquo;s leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hied him to Dame Grimhild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To her he said in haste:<br />
&ldquo;Two knights before our castle wait,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Admittance they request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O that is Folker Spillemand,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dame Grimhild she did say;<br />
&ldquo;And that is Hero Hogen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My brothers both are they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down went dames and maidens then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the twain alight;<br />
They all were slender in the waist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And just of proper height.</p>
<p>It was the proud Dame Grimhild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Herself in scarlet clad;<br />
Then out she hastened to the court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heroes in she bade.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis custom of our castle none<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A faulchion shall unsheath,<br />
I cannot bear the sight of one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since good King Sigfred&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas I that slew King Sigfred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en with my own right hand,<br />
&rsquo;Twas I that slew King Ottelin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And him could few withstand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas then I lost my acton good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trusty courser grey,<br />
In yonder ice-cold winters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When besieging Troy we lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up the hall she led them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To a hundred of her train;<br />
With naked faulchions brandished, they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Confront the heroes twain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any knight among ye be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who eat here of my bread,<br />
Will dare to slay my brother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give him gold so red.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>When heard that Folker Spillemand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He would no longer wait;<br />
His sword from out the sheath he drew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down shivered fell the gate.</p>
<p>When he had bared the mighty blade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt at heart so light;<br />
He slew full fifteen warriors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With blows of manly might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, Ha,&rdquo; said Folker Spillemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Right goes my fiddle now&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
And then the Hero Hogen slew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full twenty blow by blow.</p>
<p>It was the proud Dame Grimhild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With wrath well nigh was wode:<br />
&ldquo;Much better had ye stayed at home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than come to our abode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here will a hundred widows be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere ye this fight have done.&rdquo;<br />
Then answered Hero Hogen:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas by thyself begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>It was the Hero Hogen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His helmet lifted he:<br />
&ldquo;All under my cuirass of steel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I burn so furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m weary, weary to the heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And weak in verity;<br />
O would to God in heaven is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A horn of wine had I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted up his vizor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of human blood a draught<br />
He took&mdash;&ldquo;<i>In nomine Domini</i>&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hero Hogen quaffed.</p>
<p>See, there the knights of Grimhild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie slaughtered every one;<br />
And that has Hero Hogen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And valiant Folker done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless thee, Folker Spillemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who here a corse dost lie,<br />
Full well and without treachery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy faulchion thou didst ply.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;Full four and twenty fell for one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their death from him they found;<br />
He slew them like a warrior,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere sank he on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, brother, by my heart beloved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy coming cost me dear;<br />
How woeful is my destiny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should lose thee here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if to me is granted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To live another day,<br />
My sister this shall expiate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I her will burn or slay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evil fate&rsquo;s o&rsquo;ertaken her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s paid for all her ill;<br />
King Hogen&rsquo;s son caused Grimhild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To starve within the hill.</p>

32</span>GRIMHILD&rsquo;S VENGEANCE<br />
<i>Song the Third</i></h2>
<p>O, where will ye find kempions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So bold and strong of hand,<br />
As Hogen and his brother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Folker Spillemand?</p>
<p>Forward stepped she, Bodild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hero Hogen&rsquo;s mother, crying:<br />
&ldquo;Methought the gallant coursers all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were either dead or dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I possess full wit enow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That vision to explain;<br />
If to the Hvenish land ye go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll many a man be slain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Out rode the valiant brothers where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The river rolled its tide,<br />
There they the Mermaid found asleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath a green hill&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake, awake, thou Mermaiden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou creature wondrous fair;<br />
Say, will my life in danger be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I to Hven repair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O turn thee, Hero Hogen, back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art a knight so bold,<br />
Thou dost in thy own land possess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full many a tower and hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return, return to thine own land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek not the warrior joust,<br />
If thou dost to thy sister go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy young life it will cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Hero Hogen then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His sword he straight drew out;<br />
It was the wretched Mermaiden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From whom the head he smote.</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>&ldquo;By thee I now am prophesied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dead thou liest there;<br />
I to the land of Hven will go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon as the wind is fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then forward went the heroes two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They found the ferry-house:<br />
&ldquo;Arise, arise, good ferryman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And come here out to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen what I say to thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Convey us o&rsquo;er the Sound,<br />
And I will give thee this gold ring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It weighs full fifteen pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy bright gold ring keep thou thyself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I it will not possess,<br />
I never to the town should come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But &rsquo;twould bring me distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never should seek the town but I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should therefore sure be chidden;<br />
I shall not bear thee o&rsquo;er to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lady&rsquo;s me forbidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>And Hero Hogen grew so wroth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wroth grew he in mood;<br />
The ferryman&rsquo;s head hewed he off,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So widely reeked the blood.</p>
<p>Then straight the bloody head he cast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mid &Ouml;resund&rsquo;s swift water;<br />
And, bidding them meet in the deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He cast the body after.</p>
<p>Sir Gunter and Sir Gernot, they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their vessel steered from land;<br />
But when they reached the middle Sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tempest was at hand.</p>
<p>O then the oars asunder snapped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Folker&rsquo;s hardy hand;<br />
Here Hogen guided with his shield<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship with toil to land.</p>
<p>Then cast they out their anchors,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All on the yellow sand;<br />
It was the Hero Hogen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He stepped the first to land.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>The others they did not delay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But each as he could best<br />
Arrayed himself right manfully,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Folker &rsquo;bove the rest.</p>
<p>Abroad the warden standing was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He on the rampart strode:<br />
&ldquo;O, there are come our country to,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Athelings so proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O kemps are come our country to,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And men so bold to see;<br />
They all yclad in iron are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their steeds come springing free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one he bears a hawk in flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold on his buckler gleams;<br />
The other bears a fiddle, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A prince&rsquo;s son he seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out came she, Dame Grimhild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She so fair to speak was able:<br />
&ldquo;He does not bear a fiddle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he serves a noble&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;But they two gallant warriors are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two sprouts of Dukely tree;<br />
To know them I have cause enough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They brothers are to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Count Sir Gunselin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His warriors he bespake:<br />
&ldquo;O, hither Hero Hogen comes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fray with him we&rsquo;ll make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, we will fight with them to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we will slay them all;<br />
Then his red gold and forest green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall in our power fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then just within the portal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hero Hogen answer made:<br />
&ldquo;With you I&rsquo;ll blythely hazard that,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If ye be not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out then went the heroes all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sorely fast they hied;<br />
Then unto old as well as young<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such evil did betide.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>In hand of Folker Spillemand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword asunder flew;<br />
He seized a big steel spear, above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The door that met his view.</p>
<p>And seven such gallant warriors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He slew at the first blow:<br />
&ldquo;In Drotten&rsquo;s holy name,&rdquo; he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My fiddle be known now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now merrily my fiddle goes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye dance and spring around;<br />
I sweat with strong exertion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In my acton narrow bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Count Sir Gunselin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Grimhild&rsquo;s feet he kneeled:<br />
&ldquo;O part us from those hardy knights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or help against them yield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight on, fight on, my good men all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On whom I bread bestow;<br />
From fighting ye must not desist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till Folker lyeth low.&rdquo;</p>

39</span>&ldquo;Now hear thou, Sister Grimhild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am gored with many a wound;<br />
Thou ne&rsquo;er to me wert true or good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that I now have found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve not closed an eye, an eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For days and nights full seven;<br />

<p>&ldquo;Gone is my sword so trusty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my good steel spear&rsquo;s in twain;<br />
But all my care I would forget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I a weapon gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered him young Hubba Yern,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood by him so near:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend to thee the gallant sword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother loved so dear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methink thou art a hero bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mighty strong beside;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; On thy fiddle bow espied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then hewed he, Folker Spillemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas heard up to the sky;<br />
He&rsquo;d rather perish like a man<br />

class="footnote">[9]</a>&nbsp; The question of priority is rather
obscure, but it appears, from a letter written by Grimm in
February, 1813, in reply to the critics of his work, that his
translation was begun in 1801, when he was not aware of the work
undertaken by Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek, but that before his
book was published, Nyerup communicated to him some of the
results of the investigations of the three Danish editors.&nbsp;
Grimm seems to have worked upon an edition of Syv published in
Copenhagen in 1787, which accounts for the corrupt state of some
of Grimm&rsquo;s text.&nbsp; A good deal of unpleasant
controversy was awakened on the subject, but all this has now
long slumbered under the dust of a century.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
